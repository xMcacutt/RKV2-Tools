# RKV2 Tools
Extraction and repacking tools for the RKV2 format used by Krome Studios.
With a huge thanks to Koushi, Chippy and Pixel for working on the format.

## Extraction
To extract the RKV, simply enter "extract" where you'll be prompted to select the RKV.
You'll then be asked whether you want to extract the entire RKV or just a single file. 
If you select to extract a single file, you'll be prompted to enter the name of the file.
You'll then be asked to select the output folder for the extracted file(s).

## Repacking
To repack a folder into an RKV, simply enter "repack" where you'll be prompted to select the folder.
Another folder browser will then appear, where you'll be asked to select the output folder for the RKV.
All files and sub-files will be packed into the RKV.
The RKV will inherit the name of the initial folder you selected.
